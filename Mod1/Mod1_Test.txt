Question 31
Listed below are three common objections to the economic approach to decision-making:

1)People, firms and society DO not act this way.
2)People,firms and society SHOULD not act this way.
3)Broader social good CANNOT emerge from acting this way.

Discuss what is meant by “acting this way”, AND discuss separately one argument or “counter-point” for EACH of the THREE objections raised.

Your Answer:
In the context of the question, 'acting this way' means the economic decisions people, firms, and society make. 

Counter-points

1. While a single person, firm, or society may 'not act this way', the set of all people, firms, and societies tend to revert to the norm over time.

2. SHOULD act this way is a normative statement, a wish or opinion. We shouldn't base our study of how people, firms, and societies act based on wishes. That would make the study of econimics more fantasy than science. 

3. Measuring 'broader social good' could be posited as a testable theory or model, but that model would have to be run. Using the statement 'CANNOT emerge' indicates that the modle hasn't been tested. The statement seems to be invalid on the it's face.
