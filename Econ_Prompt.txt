I have an exam in Econ-231, Mod-1 today.  All the files you have now may be on the test. Act as a Socratic tutor and help me understand the concept of the material in Mod-1: chapters 1 and 2. Ask me multiple choice questions to guide my understanding. Reinforce my learning as we go along. The test is in 4 hours, so we have to go over the material multiple times in that time space.
